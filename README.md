## CS428/528 Project-2: Proxy Server

### SUMMARY
Two installments-
Installment1
Where a webserver and proxy server run and server request from client
Client sends request to proxyserver, which forwards it to origin server,
and accepts response from origin and forwards it to client
Proxy is the intermediatary in this instance

Installment2

Similar to installment but proxy server maintains a cache of requested objects, 
if object exists, serves it directly to client
If it does not, then forwards request to origin server, receives the response, 
saves the file in it's cache and then forwards it to client
